# Python-Calculator
I have created a very basic calculator which runs on the four standard operations.
It takes two integer inputs and requires an input operation.
It then returns the outcome of this.

As my skills improve, I would like to advance to my calculator using non-integer numerical values and
perhaps cocurrently performing operations.
